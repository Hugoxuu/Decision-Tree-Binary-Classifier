# Decision-Tree-Binary-Classifier
It is a Decision Tree learner used for binary classification. \
This ﬁle can learn a decision tree with maximum cross entropy using ID3 algorithm. \
\
You should give the program with a speciﬁed maximum depth, print the decision tree in a speciﬁed format, predict the labels of the training and testing examples, and calculate training and testing errors.
