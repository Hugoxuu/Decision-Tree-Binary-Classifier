# Decision-Tree-Binary-Classifier
It is a Decision Tree learner used for binary classification. \
This ﬁle can learn a decision tree with maximum cross entropy using ID3 algorithm. \
\
You should give the program with a speciﬁed maximum depth. \
The program can print the decision tree in a speciﬁed format, predict the labels of the training and testing examples, and calculate training and testing errors.\
\
The program parses the data sets in a certain format. Please follow the example test and train sets that are given.
